        <h1>Visual Studio</h1>
        <p>
            Visual Studio Code is a lightweight but powerful source code editor which runs on your desktop and is
            available for Windows, macOS and Linux. It comes with built-in support for JavaScript, TypeScript and Node.

        <h1>Console</h1>
        <p>A console game is a form of video game, consisting of manipulable images (and usually sounds) generated by a
            video game console and displayed on a television or similar audio-video system. The game itself is usually
            controlled and manipulated using a handheld device connected to the console, called a controller. The
            controller generally contains a number of buttons and directional controls such as analogue joysticks, each
            of which has been assigned a purpose for interacting with and controlling the images on the screen. The
            display, speakers, console, and controls of a console can also be incorporated into one small object known
            as a handheld game.</p>
